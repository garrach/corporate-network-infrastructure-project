## Project Overview

This project involves designing and implementing a secure and scalable corporate network infrastructure for a mid-sized company with multiple office locations. The primary objectives include establishing reliable communication between offices, providing centralized internet access, accommodating future growth, and ensuring robust security measures.

# Sprint 1: Planning and Setup 🚀

**Goals:**

- Define project objectives, user stories, and backlog.
- Set up collaboration tools (e.g., Jira for backlog management).
- Establish communication channels and roles within the Scrum team.

**Activities:**

1. Hold a sprint planning meeting to discuss project objectives and user stories.
2. Create a product backlog, including user stories for each major aspect of the network project.
3. Set up Jira or a similar tool for backlog management.
4. Identify roles within the Scrum team (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team).
5. Conduct a kickoff meeting to ensure everyone understands their roles and the project goals.

## Sprint 2-3: Topology Design and Simulation 🌐

**Goals:**

- Design the network topology and simulate its functionality.

**Activities:**

1. Break down user stories related to topology design and simulation.
2. Utilize Cisco Packet Tracer for designing and simulating the network.
3. Hold regular sprint review and planning meetings to assess progress and plan for the next sprint.
4. Document the initial design and simulation findings.

## Sprint 4-5: Hardware and Software Selection 💻

**Goals:**

- Select networking hardware and software based on the design.

**Activities:**

1. Break down user stories related to hardware and software selection.
2. Research and select networking hardware (routers, switches, firewalls) and software (Ansible, Snort).
3. Document the chosen hardware and software specifications.
4. Conduct regular sprint reviews and planning meetings to track progress.

## Sprint 6-7: Configuration and Automation ⚙️

**Goals:**

- Begin the configuration of routers and switches using Ansible.

**Activities:**

1. Break down user stories related to configuration and automation.
2. Start implementing Ansible scripts for device configuration.
3. Conduct testing and validation of automated configurations.
4. Document the configuration process and scripts.

## Sprint 8-9: Security Implementation 🔒

**Goals:**

- Implement security measures using Cisco ASA and Snort.

**Activities:**

1. Break down user stories related to security implementation.
2. Configure Cisco ASA firewalls for perimeter security.
3. Integrate Snort for intrusion detection and prevention.
4. Conduct security testing and document the implemented measures.

## Sprint 10-11: VPN Setup and Quality of Service  🚀

**Goals:**

- Establish secure communication between offices (VPN).
- Implement Quality of Service (QoS) policies.

**Activities:**

1. Break down user stories related to VPN setup and QoS implementation.
2. Configure and test OpenVPN for secure communication.
3. Implement QoS policies using Cisco features.
4. Document the VPN and QoS configurations.

## Sprint 12-13: Monitoring and Documentation 📊

**Goals:**

- Set up network monitoring using Nagios.
- Create comprehensive documentation.

**Activities:**

1. Break down user stories related to monitoring and documentation.
2. Install and configure Nagios for network monitoring.
3. Create detailed documentation for the network design, configurations, and security policies.
4. Conduct a final review of the documentation.

## Sprint 14-15: Training, Handover, and Support 🤝

**Goals:**

- Conduct training sessions for IT staff.
- Hand over documentation and credentials.
- Define SLAs for post-implementation support.

**Activities:**

1. Break down user stories related to training and handover.
2. Conduct training sessions for IT staff.
3. Hand over documentation and credentials.
4. Define SLAs for post-implementation support and set up a ticketing system.

## Sprint Review and Retrospective 🔄

Hold a final sprint review and retrospective meeting to assess the overall project, gather feedback, and identify lessons learned. Use this information for continuous improvement in future projects.
